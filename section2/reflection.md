## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* Forcing myself to challenge the way I code, I am looking for easy answers instead of pushing the boundary. I can figure something out, and be done with it or I can attempt to apply more of my knowledge to these single lines of code. Break to build seems to be a theme with programming..
* Being open to feedback and suggestions, my time in the classroom has not been ideal. I knew coming to Turing would be a truly different experience and I can say so far this is nothing like I've seen before. I know that I might not have all the tools as of right now to solve the problems I encountered in my "self taught" and I use the term loosely.. but getting feedback from peers/instructors is scary but necessary and I need to dive in head first, no need to be afraid!


2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I utilize SMART goals, or understand them for that matter enough to incorporate them into my daily routine. I also have zero issue asking for help, I am the first person to say "I have no idea" and "Give me a second, I'm working through my process" but with Turing for some reason I feel embarrassed asking for help, it almost seems like everyone has such a good grasp on things. I work with some folks and their thought process is similar to mine which is cool but I have to keep that in the forefront of my mind. **ASKING FOR HELP IS A GOOD THING** and my questions can most likely help someone else if not be a good reminder for those who are taking their time to provide clarity.


3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
* It was a good test/reminder that directions are good but you need to practice outside of directions, make your own versions of these examples and play with stuff. Break it to build it is an awesome saying I heard from one of my pro dev friends.. it could just be to keep me motivated but either way it works for me!


4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

* Conditional statements allow for us to direct the computer to do `this set of instructions` or `that set of instructions` under specific conditions. An example would be something as simple as driving. There are multiple conditions when you drive, thinking of how to get to your designated location. Most of the time there is more than one way home, you could use the variable `trafficStops = true;` and `wayHome = ""` the second variable could have as many ways as possible to get home. Dependent upon the `trafficStops` different blocks of code will be ran. Maybe within one of the blocks of code the string says something along the lines of `"Traffic is bad, I might want to stop somewhere to let it die down"` and another block holds the string `"Lets take the back way home"`.
* I log in to my email regularly, conditional statements apply to this as well. When logging into my account, they ask for a username and password. If the username/password does not fit what has been stored into my account originally a different set of instructions will be ran via `Incorrect username/password` and there will be a prompt asking me `Forgot password`. This will throw me into another conditional statement that will run me through the process of resetting my password. Or even to the point of me getting locked out of my account... which happens all the time, stating from experience..



5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
**else/if** the program will begin at the opening statement, check to see if the conditions have been met, if not move to the next block of code until the conditions have been met and the program will stop executing.


6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
**Chrome dev tools** I can take out specific lines of code and run them independently outside of the full script. I can also test certain lines with plug ins or packages is a better word within the IDE I am using. I have more experience using VS code but have yet to really play with atom. I am not sure if that would be considered cheating, but I will ask in the SLACK channel at some point.


7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
* I was bullied by the if statement with multiple variables and kept seeing a similar syntax error `![Stuff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86126203/149057807-a488022a-b6ef-468e-9b30-8ed8104ad9b5.jpeg)
` but I have seen the code written like this, I am sure it is a minor error on my part but I will figure it out eventually.
