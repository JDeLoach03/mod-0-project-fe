## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
* I am still getting more comfortable with asking questions, I am making a list of questions with inline code examples in a DM to myself to increase my comfort levels for starters with openly asking questions. It also serves as a way to reflect on topics discussed and after a few times trying it, or even thinking on the subject I have gained some level of understanding. I am using the vocab list I have made (which I will be improving with flash cards during and after mod0) to speak technically about my problems. I have noticed I struggle with this part, looking at the Turing "guide on asking questions" I saw a fantastic setup, with details and strong articulation and I think using this as a template WILL increase my understanding. I also have a tech friend who is far outside of his beginning coding phases but he listens to my questions and helps me focus in on asking better questions.
* I write them down and then wait a full day or so to see if they get answered in the SLACK channel. It has worked so far in a sense of me not having many questions overall, but I see this biting me in the butt when the topics become more abstract and require more attention. My favorite technique from the article would have to be the rubber duck debugging, don't have one of those but I can find something to put in its place. Me explaining concepts to an inanimate object has to be one of the best ideas I have ever heard. I often find my thoughts very scrambled, and to help me in my previous jobs I would write down questions, think about them for a few minutes and explain them to myself in the car on the way home or something like that so I was kind of doing this method already... Lastly, understanding the answer and asking questions to solidify that I am comprehending will help me not make the same mistake millions of times.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
// All of these data types would be considered as primitive or very basic in nature.
> 1. Numbers
// Information we are storing that relates to any positive, negative or decimal point integer.
> 2. Strings
// Information stored as a value such as letters, unique characters or numbers wrapped inside of `""`.
> 3. Booleans
// This data type will determine if a value is `true` or `false`. This data type is useful in conditional statements.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
```javascript
console.log("Hello World!");
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// Are used to comment or explain why you wrote a specific line of code or to break parts of your code up/not run specific lines while testing your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
* Information stored that we can call, do something to, or change.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

* I use all kinds of websites but for my most used being Youtube, all three of the variable types are used. Booleans for conditional statements of "If this event, then this will happen". Numbers and strings are used in the titles of videos/content creators as well as in the about me section. `Yo, I'm NICKMERCS` with more details in his about me section which could include `Overall amount made from tournaments: $172,075.01`.

* There is a website to see how your favorite gamers stack up with actual amount earned from gaming. There are so many variables to choose from ranging from `var amount = 172,075.01;` to `var name = NICKMERCS;` to `var originOfPlayer = United States`. These variables will change depending on who is being viewed, it could be a player from a different region of the world, or even if the stratification is broken down by game type instead of specific player.. this one was very difficult for me to think of due to the amount of possibilities.


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
* From my understanding, concatenation is linking strings together using the variable with the + operator. Just have to be careful with spacing of the strings between the `var name` and `+ operator`.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
* With all the information posted into youtube or updating profiles/earning amount.. updating this information would be as simple as referencing the variable `${variableName}` instead of `("Gamer and his amount")` or `(Specific amount made)`. Or when logging longer sentences within the console this reference of `${shortVersion}` is easier to type than `(This is a longer sentence and I have to type more)`.


9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

* I am curious of the different uses for strings, I saw one example in interpolation that used `back quotes` instead of `"quotation marks"` or `'apostrophe marks'`. Also ran into an issue that I believe is part of the atom setup, but I need to do more research in it. My atom does not respond when called in my terminal unless atom is open, but I would rather address this after finishing mod0.
